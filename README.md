# Customer-Behavior-Analysis-with-SQL
Owner of a new diner asked for an analysis of his customers' behavior  to help him make better business decisions.
Danny decided to start a japanese diner where he sells sushi,ramen and curry. Since starting this diner, Danny has been collecting some data on his customers but he has no idea how to use it. Therefore, some of the questions Danny would like to get answers to include customer visisting patterns, customer expenditure, and customers' favorite menu items. These are of great importance to Danny as they will allow him to understand his customers better and therefore help him deliver a personalized experience that will keep them coming back for more. The insights provided in this SQL project also help Danny decide whether to expand the diner's current loyalty program. The output of this project provides some basic datasets for Danny and his team which they can easily inspect without having to use SQL.
